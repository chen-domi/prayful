# 🙏 Prayful

A community where prayer requests meet collective faith

## What is Prayful?

Prayful is a prayer community app that connects people who need prayer with those who want to pray. It's a safe, supportive space where you can share your burdens, uplift others, and witness the power of collective prayer.

Whether you're going through a difficult time, celebrating a victory, or simply want to pray for others, Prayful brings believers together in faith.
